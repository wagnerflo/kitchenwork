\startsection[title={Lemon Gingerini},reference=lemongingerini]
Apart from the very clever name that manages to include all of the
ingredients in just two words this is also a interesting combination.

Since there is already quite a bit of spiciness in the drink due to the
Ginger syrup take care not to use too strong a Gin if you don't have
Hendrick's at hand.

As in just about any drink a sugar coated rim is not just used to make
the drink look nice but also alters the flavour.
